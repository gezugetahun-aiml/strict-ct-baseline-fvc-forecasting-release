# Strict CT-Baseline Multimodal FVC Forecasting — Reproducibility Release

**Current archived v1.1.0 DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23926713

**Historical v1.0.0 DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23911990

This repository is the **sanitized public reproducibility release** for the manuscript *Strict CT-Baseline Multimodal Learning for Future FVC Prediction in Pulmonary Fibrosis*.

## Data-use and privacy boundary

The release does **not** contain:

- original OSIC clinical CSV files or DICOM images;
- OSIC pseudonymous patient identifiers;
- any source-ID-to-release-ID crosswalk;
- row-level OOF target/prediction files containing source-derived patient trajectories;
- per-patient clinical measurements that could facilitate linkage back to the source dataset.

The `PF###` labels are one-time study-specific anonymous release labels. They are not hashes, are not derived from OSIC identifiers or clinical values, and are not intended to identify which source patient corresponds to a particular release label.

## What is released

- the frozen final-v10 model source;
- executable code implementing the strict CT-baseline eligibility rule;
- executable code implementing the deterministic patient-balanced five-fold construction used in the manuscript;
- an anonymous cohort-structure manifest containing release label, fold, and number of future targets only;
- aggregate fold summaries and aggregate manuscript/reviewer results;
- scripts that authorized OSIC users can run locally to reconstruct the exact source-ID strict cohort, exclusions, future targets, outer folds, OOF metrics, reviewer oracle analysis, catastrophic-error table, clinical-temporal Ridge baseline, and the Reviewer-2 baseline-only outer-fold sensitivity analysis.

## Reproducibility workflow

Researchers with authorized access to the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression dataset should obtain the original `train.csv` and DICOM data from the authorized source. Then run:

```bash
python analysis/rebuild_strict_cohort_and_folds.py --train-csv /path/to/train.csv
```

For the manuscript dataset, the script should reproduce:

- 176 source patients;
- 29 strict eligible patients;
- 147 excluded patients;
- 231 strictly post-CT future targets;
- the deterministic five outer folds used in the manuscript.

The locally regenerated files retain the original source identifiers and are written under `local_outputs/`, which is excluded from Git.

The anonymous `PF###` manifest is therefore a public description of cohort/fold structure, not a crosswalk to the source data. Exact source-level verification is performed locally by rerunning the supplied eligibility and fold-construction code on an authorized OSIC copy.

## Manuscript reference results

- MAE: **169.416 mL**
- RMSE: **243.886 mL**
- modified Laplace log-likelihood: **-6.954222**
- mean predicted uncertainty: **196.857 mL**
- predictions with absolute error >=500 mL: **14**

Reviewer-requested diagnostics:

- persistence MAE/RMSE: **210.100 / 293.985 mL**
- retrospective oracle-best-expert MAE/RMSE: **99.029 / 182.002 mL**
- catastrophic targets outside the seven-expert prediction range: **14/14**
- catastrophic cases remaining >=500 mL under retrospective oracle selection: **10/14**

## Reviewer 2 outer-fold sensitivity

A post-hoc sensitivity analysis changes **only the outer patient partition** so that fold assignment uses prediction-origin variables rather than future-derived progression descriptors. Assignment uses Age, Sex, SmokingStatus, baseline FVC, Percent, baseline week, CT-derived FSS, and patient-count balancing. PatientSlope, rapid-decliner status, future-target count, future horizon, future FVC, and held-out prediction error are excluded from outer-fold assignment.

On the same 29 patients and 231 targets, the baseline-only outer-fold sensitivity achieved:

- MAE: **198.402 mL** versus 169.416 mL in the submitted partition; paired ΔMAE **+28.986 mL** (95% patient-cluster bootstrap CI 1.306 to 57.002).
- RMSE: **267.997 mL** versus 243.886 mL; paired ΔRMSE **+24.111 mL** (95% CI -3.619 to 50.666).
- modified LLL: **-7.053661** versus -6.954222; paired ΔLLL **-0.099438** (95% CI -0.321323 to 0.133370).
- absolute errors >=500 mL: **18** versus 14.

This analysis is reported as a reviewer-requested sensitivity analysis, not a replacement primary analysis. It indicates that outer-fold composition materially affects estimated MAE in the small strict cohort. See `docs/reviewer2_comment2_outerfold_sensitivity.md`.

## Recomputing prediction metrics

After generating local OOF predictions with the frozen model:

```bash
python analysis/analyze_local_oof.py --oof local_outputs/your_oof.csv
python analysis/make_catastrophic_expert_range_table.py --oof local_outputs/your_oof.csv
```

## Availability boundary

The 231-row submitted OOF file is intentionally not distributed because exact row-level source-derived trajectories can remain linkable even after direct identifiers are removed. Aggregate reference values are provided so authorized users can verify their locally regenerated outputs.

## Clinical-use disclaimer

This repository supports research reproducibility. The model has not undergone external or prospective clinical validation and is not a clinical decision-support system.
